Seriously.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;
	From Google (&lt;a href="http://goo.gl/lQN2V" target="_blank"&gt;http://goo.gl/lQN2V&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&amp;quot;Two bills before Congress, known as the Protect IP Act (PIPA) in the Senate and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House, would censor the Web and impose harmful regulations on American business. Millions of Internet users and entrepreneurs already oppose SOPA and PIPA.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&amp;quot;The Senate will begin voting on January 24th. Please let them know how you feel. Sign this petition urging Congress to vote NO on PIPA and SOPA before it is too late.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sign the petition. Preserve the web.&lt;/p&gt;
